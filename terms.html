        <h1>BU-ISCIII Galaxy Portal Service Agreement</h1>

        <p>
        1) Use of Service. BU-ISCIII Galaxy Portal is a free, private, 
Intranet accessible resource (the "Service"). Data transfer and data 
storage are not encrypted. If there are restrictions on the way your 
research data can be stored and used, please consult your local 
institutional review board or the project principal investigator before
uploading it. If you have protected data, large data storage requirements,
 or short deadlines you are encouraged to contact us (Bioinformatics Unit)
 or set up your own local Galaxy instance and not use this Service. Your 
access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons deemed 
necessary by the operators of the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
        2) Accounts and Service Limitations. You will need to register 
an account with the Service in order to use it. This account must be 
linked to an exsiting ISCIII email address and have to be accepted by 
the mantainers of the service. Your registration data is primarily used so
you may persistently store data on the Service and use advanced Galaxy 
features such as sharing and workflows. The operators of the Service 
will not provide your registration data to any third party unless 
required to do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under 
the condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, 
job submissions, or any other limitations placed on the Service. 
Attempts to subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or 
through any other method may result in termination of all associated 
accounts. This service is designed as an analysis platform and not for
data storage porpouses, thus there is no backup of the uploaded data 
neither of the analysis results. The users are responsable of keeping track 
of their data, download their results and remove useless files.
        </p>

        <p>
        3) Disclaimer. The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" 
BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, 
without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability 
or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an 
essential part of this service agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
        4) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no 
legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, shall Instituto de Salud Carlos III or any other entity 
which provides resources for the Service be liable to anyone for any 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
 arising as a result of the use of this Service including, without 
limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent 
applicable law prohibits such limitation.
